# Gift Card Generator Web Application

This project is a mobile-optimized gift card generator website where users can select gift card types and amounts, and generate free gift card codes. The website is designed to be simple and responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience on mobile devices.

## Features

- **Gift Card Type Selection**: Users can choose from various gift card options such as iTunes, Google Play, Amazon, and Online Shopping Gift Cards.
- **Amount Selection**: Users can select different amounts like $5, $10, $15, $25, $50, and $100 for their selected gift card.
- **Thumbnail Update**: The thumbnail image dynamically updates based on the selected gift card type.
- **Claim Now Button**: Users can click the 'Claim Now' button, which redirects them to a designated website.
- **Get Free Button**: Users can generate a free gift card code by clicking the 'Get Free' button.
- **Popunder and Social Bar Ads**: The website includes ads that activate upon page load and user interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is optimized for mobile devices and provides a professional look with appropriate margins and spacing.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**

## How It Works

1. **Gift Card Type Selection**: Users select a gift card type from the dropdown menu.
2. **Amount Selection**: After selecting the gift card type, users choose an amount.
3. **Get Free Button**: Clicking the "Get Free" button will generate a random redeem code (implementation not included in this version).
4. **Claim Now Button**: Clicking the "Claim Now" button redirects users to an external website (example link: `https://www.ex.com`).
5. **Popunder Ads**: A popunder ad activates when the page loads or when the user clicks anywhere on the page.
6. **Social Bar Ads**: A social bar ad is included at the bottom of the page for additional monetization.

## Files Included

- **index.html**: The main structure of the webpage.
- **style.css**: Stylesheet for styling the page elements.
- **script.js**: JavaScript for handling interactions (e.g., thumbnail update).
- **Images**: Contains the necessary images like `giftcardlist.png`, `itunes.png`, `googleplay.png`, etc.
- **Ad Scripts**: External scripts for popunder and social bar ads.

Ad Integration
To integrate Popunder and Social Bar ads, two external JavaScript files are used:

Popunder Ad:

<script type='text/javascript' src='//pl24409727.cpmrevenuegate.com/0f/d7/f8/0fd7f835ab7c0669ca99f95cb343e0bc.js'></script>

Notes
Ensure that ads are functioning properly by disabling any ad blockers in your browser.
The generated redeem code is currently a placeholder. You can implement server-side functionality to generate valid codes or retrieve them from an API.
